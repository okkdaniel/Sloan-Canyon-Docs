# Gear Ratios

**When working with gears/sprockets in VEX robotics, you often need to determine how the gear ratio affects the output RPM of your robot's mechanisms.**

Gear Ratios are also applicable to sprockets

## Understanding Gear Ratios

The gear ratio affects the rotational speed (RPM) and torque between the driving gear (attached to the motor) and the driven gear (connected to the mechanism). A gear ratio is the ratio of the rotational speeds between two meshing gears or within a gear train. It represents how the input speed of the driving gear compares to the output speed of the driven gear. Essentially, it determines how speed and torque are transferred through the gears. You can select a gear ratio based on whether you want to prioritize speed (with a large gear driving a smaller gear) or torque (with a small gear driving a larger gear).

## Calculating RPM/Torque

<span style={{ fontSize: '1.5em' }}>
  *Calculating Output RPM*
</span>

To calculate the output RPM of the driven gear based on the gear ratio and motor RPM, use this formula: 

```c
Output RPM = (Driving Gear / Driven Gear) * Motor RPM
```

  *Calculating Output Torque*
</span>

To calculate the output RPM of the driven gear based on the gear ratio, use this formula:

```c
Output Torque = (Driven Gear / Driving Gear)
```

## Example Calculations

<span style={{ fontSize: '1.5em' }}>
  *Example Calculation - Speed Ratio*
</span>

```c
- The driving gear has 36 teeth.
- the driven gear has 12 teeth.
- the motor output is 200 rpm.

Output RPM = (36 / 12) * 200 = 600 RPM
Output Torque = (12 / 36) = 1 / 3
```
This means that the output RPM is 3 times the amount of the motor RPM. while the output torque is 1/3 that of the motor torque.

<span style={{ fontSize: '1.5em' }}>
  *Example Calculation - Torque Ratio*
</span> 

```c
- The driving gear has 12 teeth.
- The driven gear has 36 teeth.
- The motor output is 200 rpm.

Output RPM = (12 / 36) * 200 = 66.6667 RPM
Output Torque = (36 / 12) = 3
```
This means that the output RPM is 1/3 the amount of the motor RPM, while the output torque is 3 times that of the motor torque.
