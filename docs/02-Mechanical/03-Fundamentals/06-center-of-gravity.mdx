# Center of Gravity

**The center of gravity (COG) in VEX robots is the point where the total weight of the robot is considered to be concentrated. Understanding and optimizing the COG is crucial for building stable and effective robots. Keeping a low COG is important.**

:::info[Example]
- Below is an example of a robot with a high COG, which resulted in them tipping over when slightly hit by another robot or field element.

## Low Center of Gravity

1. **Stability**: A lower COG reduces the risk of tipping over, especially during fast movements, sudden stops, or collisions. This is crucial for maintaining control and ensuring the robot can handle dynamic maneuvers.

2. **Balance on Inclines**: Robots with a low COG are less likely to tip when navigating ramps or uneven terrain, improving their ability to complete tasks that involve such challenges.

3. **Improved Traction**: With a low COG, more weight is distributed to the wheels, increasing traction. This can be particularly important in pushing battles or when the robot needs to overcome obstacles.

## Centralized Center of Gravity

1. **Even Weight Distribution**: A centered COG ensures that the weight is evenly distributed across all wheels or points of contact with the ground. This prevents any one wheel from bearing too much load, which can cause uneven wear or reduced performance.

2. **Predictable Handling**: When the COG is centered, the robot's movements become more predictable. It turns more smoothly and responds better to controls, making it easier to maneuver accurately.

3. **Minimized Stress on Components**: A centered COG reduces the stress on the robot's frame and drivetrain. This can prevent structural issues and extend the lifespan of the robot's components.

## Managing Center of Gravity

1. **Distribute Weight Evenly**: Place heavy components (like batteries and motors) as low and as close to the center of the robot as possible.

2. **Symmetrical Design**: Aim for a symmetrical design where weight is balanced evenly on all sides.

4. **Test and Iterate**: Regularly test your robot to identify any balance issues and adjust the COG accordingly. Stop and accelerate rapidly to test tipping and COG.
