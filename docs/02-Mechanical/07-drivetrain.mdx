# Tank Drive

**Tank Drive is the most popular type of drivetrain in VEX due to its simplicity and adaptability.**
:::info[Example]
- Below is a CAD Render of a standard VEX Tank Drive with a gear train. This drivetrain is 360rpm output on 3.25 inch omni-directional wheels.

## Tank Drive Basics

1. **Tank Drive Mechanism:** In a tank drive system, the robot is driven by two separate motors, one for each side of the robot (left and right). Each motor controls a set of wheels or tracks on its respective side.

2. **Movement Control:** When both sides move forward, the robot moves straight ahead. When one side moves forward while the other moves backward, the robot can turn. The speed of the motors on each side determines the speed and turning radius of the robot.

## Gear Train

1. **Purpose:** The gear train in a tank drive system is used to transfer power from the motors to the wheels. Gears can also change the speed and torque of the wheel output. (Read more about Gear Trains and power transmission [here](\docs\02-Mechanical\03-Fundamentals\04-power-transmission.mdx))

2. **Components:** A typical gear train includes:

    - *Motor Gear:* Attached to the motor's output shaft.
    - *Gear Shaft:* Transfers motion from the motor gear to the wheels.
    - *Wheels:* The final components that make contact with the ground.

3. **Gear Ratios:** Gear ratios affect the speed and torque. For example, a higher gear ratio (more teeth on the driving gear than the driven gear) will increase torque but reduce speed. Conversely, a lower gear ratio will increase speed but reduce torque (Read more about Gear Ratios [here](\docs\02-Mechanical\03-Fundamentals\05-gear-ratios.mdx)).

## How It Works Together

1. **Motor to Gear Train:** The motors rotate, and this rotation is transferred to the gear train. Depending on the gear ratio, this will either increase or decrease the speed and torque. (Read more about Gear Ratios [here](\docs\02-Mechanical\03-Fundamentals\05-gear-ratios.mdx)).

2. **Gear Train to Wheels:** The final output of the gear train drives the wheels or tracks. The configuration of the gears (whether they are in a direct drive, reduction drive, or other configuration) will determine how the robot moves.

## Implementation

- **Gear Ratios:** Choose gear ratios based on the desired balance between speed and torque. For example, if you need more pushing power, choose a lower output RPM. For faster movement, choose a higher output RPM. (Read more about Gear Ratios [here](\docs\02-Mechanical\03-Fundamentals\05-gear-ratios.mdx)).
- **Gear Alignment:** Ensure gears are properly aligned and meshed to avoid wear and inefficiency. (Read more about Center to Center distance [here](/docs/Mechanical/Fundamentals/power-transmission#center-to-center-distance)).
- **Motor Power:** Ensure the motors you are using can handle the load that will be put on them by the gear train and wheels.
