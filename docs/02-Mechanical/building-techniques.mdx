# Building Techniques

## Boxing

**Boxing is a building technique used to improve the rigidity of C-Channels placed on the robot.**

    - Boxing prevents the C-Channel from caving in and twisting, therefor is a useful technique, and should be used everywhere possible.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a YouTube tutorial by ***[4253B](https://www.youtube.com/@ryan4253b/)*** on Boxing C-Channels using spacers and keps nuts.

1. **Spacer Boxing**
    - Spacer Boxing consists of placing 2 spacers inbetween the flanges of a C-Channel. The spacer combination should always add up to .875in(The distance between the inner walls in a C-Channel). This is the easiest form of boxing, and is more commonly used than other boxing types.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a picture of Spacer Boxing using .5in OD Nylon Spacers for the most surface area possible on the flanges of the C-Channel.

:::warning[Warning]
Spacer Boxing typically only works on Aluminum C-Channels, this is because Steel C-Channels have thinner walls, and the distance between the 2 inner walls is not .875in

2. **Keps Boxing**
    - Keps Boxing consists of placing 2 Keps Nuts opposite to each other inbetween the flanges of a C-Channel. Keps Box spacing does not matter, and can be used on Steel C-Channels. This boxing technique is typically used in specific situations, such as boxing around bearings or screws behind the box itself.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a picture of Keps Boxing specifically used in this situation to get around bearing blocks that were placed in the middle of the C-Channel, where spacers would not fit.

## Screw Joints

**Screw Joints are a building technique used to increase rigidity, reduce friction, and replace shafts in some cases.**

    - Screw joints reduce friction and increase rigidity by preventing relative rotation between the axle and the attached component, while also serving as a structural screw, effectively killing two birds with one stone. Screw joints are a useful building technique and should be used wherever possible.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a YouTube tutorial by ***[4253B](https://www.youtube.com/@ryan4253b/)*** on Screw Joints.

:::

:::info[Example]
- Below is a CAD example of how a regular Screw Joint should be built. The screw head is constrained between the 2 C-Channels using keps nuts, then finally becomes structurally integral with the locking nut on the outside.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a picture of a Screw Joint used to mount a hinged intake. The screw is constrained by a keps nut, and cannot spin, therefor the attached component is spinning around the screw. If this were a shaft, it would bend and slightly spin, causing slop and friction.

:::warning[Warning]
There are situations where Screw Joints should not be used. For example, long distance motion where everything in that axis needs to be able to spin. In that case, use shafts.

## Triangle Bracing

**Triangle Bracing is a building technique used to increase rigiditdy of tall towers and other vertical, horizontal, and perpendicular structures.**

    - Triangles are the strongest structural shape in VEX and structures in general, and prevent tall towers and other structures from twisting and bending in a certain direction. Triangle Bracing is not specific to tall towers, and can be used to brace perpendicular structures to increase rigidity, and should be used anywhere possible.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a picture of Triangle Bracing used to prevent C-Channel towers from bending in certain directions, increasing the rigidity of the structure overall. Triangle Bracing is not limited to standoffs coupled to shaft collars, but this specific example uses this method due to space restrictions. If this were not Triangle Braced, the towers would bend in different directions, decreasing the quality of the robot.

:::

:::info[Example]
- Below is another example of Triangle Bracing, which had multiple functions including bracing the towers, serving as an expansion mount, and wheel mounts. If this Triangle Brace did not exist, there would be no place to mount rollers or expansion, and the structural integrity of the towers would weaken by a large margin.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a 3rd and final example of Triangle Bracing, used on an intake hood to keep both sides level and rigid. If this plastic brace did not exist, both sides probably would not have been rigid, with each side moving kind of independently and twisting.

## Squaring

**Squaring refers to keeping structure straight and everything aligned on the robot. This increases rigidity and decreases friction on the robot.**

    - Squaring is mainly used when building drivetrains in VEX. This building technique keeps the C-Channels and other structures on the drive aligned, which ensures that shafts, added spinning components, and additional hardware is straight and rigid. Although this technique is mainly used for drivetrains, it can be applied to other subsystems and structures on the robot. This method should be applied anywhere possible.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a YouTube tutorial by ***[4253B](https://www.youtube.com/@ryan4253b/)*** on Squaring drivetrains.
