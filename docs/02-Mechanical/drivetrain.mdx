# Tank Drive

**Tank Drive is the most popular type of drivetrain in VEX due to its simplicity and adaptability.**
:::info[Example]
- Below is a CAD Render of a standard VEX Tank Drive with a gear train. This drivetrain is 360rpm output on 3.25 inch omni-directional wheels.

## Tank Drive Basics

1. **Tank Drive Mechanism:** In a tank drive system, the robot is driven by two separate motors, one for each side of the robot (left and right). Each motor controls a set of wheels or tracks on its respective side.

2. **Movement Control:** When both sides move forward, the robot moves straight ahead. When one side moves forward while the other moves backward, the robot can turn. The speed of the motors on each side determines the speed and turning radius of the robot.

## Gear Train

1. **Purpose:** The gear train in a tank drive system is used to transfer power from the motors to the wheels. Gears can also change the speed and torque of the wheel output.

2. **Components:** A typical gear train includes:

    - *Motor Gear:* Attached to the motor's output shaft.
    - *Gear Shaft:* Transfers motion from the motor gear to the wheels.
    - *Wheels:* The final components that make contact with the ground.
