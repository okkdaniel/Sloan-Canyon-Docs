# Getting Started

Robot mechanics is very important to competing in VEX Robotics. Building techniques, design, and general practices can shape the quality of the robot.

# Learning Path

Below are some tips to improve robot design, this will not go over the basics of robot creation. However resources have been provided for you to self-learn and be introduced to common-sense practices.

## Building Techniques

### Boxing

**Boxing is a building technique used to improve the rigidity of C-Channels placed on the robot.**

    - Boxing prevents the C-Channel from caving in and twisting, therefor is a useful technique, and should be used everywhere possible.

- Below is a boxing tutorial by 4253B on Boxing C-Channels using spacers and keps nuts.

1. **Spacer Boxing**
    - Spacer Boxing consists of placing 2 spacers inbetween the flanges of a C-Channel. The spacer combination should always add up to .875in(The distance between the inner walls in a C-Channel). This is the easiest form of boxing, and is more commonly used than other boxing types.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a picture of Spacer Boxing used on 74177M's 2023 January Robot. This used .5in OD Nylon Spacers for the most surface area possible on the flanges of the C-Channel.

:::warning[Warning]

Spacer Boxing typically only works on Aluminum C-Channels, this is because Steel C-Channels have thinner walls, and the distance between the 2 inner walls is not .875in

2. **Keps Boxing**
    - Keps Boxing consists of placing 2 Keps Nuts opposite to each other inbetween the flanges of a C-Channel. Keps Box spacing does not matter, and can be used on Steel C-Channels. This boxing technique is typically used in specific situations, such as boxing around bearings and screws behind the box itself.

:::info[Example]
- Below is a picture of Keps Boxing also used on 74177M's 2023 January Robot. Keps Boxing was specifically used in this situation to get around bearing blocks that were placed in the middle of the C-Channel, where spacers would not fit.
